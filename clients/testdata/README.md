# kJSON Test Data

This directory contains standardized test files for validating kJSON implementations across different languages.

## Test Files

### Valid Files
- `basic.kjson` - Basic JSON types and JSON5 features
- `extended.kjson` - Extended types (UUID, Decimal128, BigInt, Date)
- `complex.kjson` - Real-world complex nested structures

### Invalid Files
- `invalid/syntax_errors.kjson` - Various syntax errors for error handling tests

### Binary Files
- `binary/` - Binary format test files (to be generated by implementations)

## Testing Strategy

Each implementation should:

1. **Parse all valid files** without errors
2. **Serialize parsed data** and verify round-trip consistency
3. **Handle invalid files** gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. **Binary format tests** - encode/decode with byte-level verification

## Expected Behavior

### Type Mapping
- BigInt values (with `n` suffix) should map to appropriate large integer type
- Decimal128 values (with `m` suffix) should preserve precision
- UUID values (unquoted) should be parsed as UUID objects, not strings
- ISO dates should be parsed as date/time objects

### Round-Trip Testing
```
Original kJSON → Parse → Internal representation → Serialize → kJSON
```

The output should be semantically equivalent to the input (may differ in formatting).

## Running Tests

See each language implementation's README for specific test commands.

## Adding Test Cases

When adding new test cases:
1. Add to appropriate file or create new file
2. Document the test case purpose
3. Update all implementations to handle the new case
4. Verify cross-language compatibility
